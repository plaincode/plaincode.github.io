# Project Mission

This repository is the source for **plaincode.github.io**, the static GitHub Pages homepage for plaincode app development.

## Project Context
- Migration target: replace the former WordPress content with a static, fast, maintainable site.
- Hosting: GitHub Pages.
- Main branch/source: `master`.
- Domain: `plaincode.github.io`.

## Current Site Structure

### Core pages
- `index.html` — homepage / posts overview.
- `apps.html` — apps overview page.
- `products/index.html` — SEO-compatible products overview (`/products/`).

### SEO-compatible product detail routes
Keep these exact directory routes:
- `/products/clinometer/` → `products/clinometer/index.html`
- `/products/magnetmeter/` → `products/magnetmeter/index.html`
- `/products/accelmeter/` → `products/accelmeter/index.html`
- `/products/isetsquare/` → `products/isetsquare/index.html`
- `/products/contactsbynumber/` → `products/contactsbynumber/index.html`
- `/products/magichue/` → `products/magichue/index.html`

### Shared assets
- Global styles: `style.css`
- Global script: `script.js`
- Branding/logo/icons: `images/icons/*`
- Store badges: `images/app-store-badge.svg`, `images/google-play-badge.png`
- App media/screenshots: `images/apps/*`, `images/screenshots/*`, `images/other/*`
- Fonts: `fonts/*`

## Content & Layout Consistency Rules

### 1) Header consistency (critical)
When editing or adding pages, keep the header structure and branding consistent across all pages:
- Use the same `site-header` + `header-content` block.
- Include both logo image and text brand in `h1.site-logo`:
	- logo: `/images/icons/plaincode_logo.jpg`
	- text: `plaincode`
- Keep navigation style/classes consistent (`main-nav`, active link state).

### 2) Head metadata consistency
All pages should include:
- responsive viewport meta tag
- meaningful page-specific description meta tag
- favicon links:
	- `/images/icons/favicon-32.png`
	- `/images/icons/apple-touch-icon.png`

### 3) Styling discipline
- Reuse existing classes and patterns from `style.css`.
- Avoid introducing one-off inline styles.
- Prefer extending shared CSS rules instead of page-specific overrides.

### 4) App store links/badges
- Do **not** reintroduce Windows Store/Windows Phone links.
- Use official App Store / Google Play badges where store links are shown.
- Keep badge markup consistent with existing `store-badge` usage.

### 5) URL/path safety
- Preserve existing URL structure for SEO/backward compatibility.
- Use root-relative paths for shared assets (e.g. `/style.css`, `/images/...`) on nested pages.
- Do not rename product slug folders unless explicitly requested.

### 6) Accessibility basics
- Keep descriptive `alt` text for meaningful images/icons.
- Preserve semantic heading order (`h1` for site logo/title block, `h2` page title, then `h3`/`h4`).

## When Updating Content

Before finishing content updates:
- Verify header/logo/nav consistency with other pages.
- Verify store links still point to the correct app pages.
- Verify no broken HTML structure (especially in app-card sections).
- Verify no missing shared assets or incorrect relative paths.
- Keep wording and tone consistent with existing plaincode style.

## Scope Guidance for AI Edits
- Prefer minimal, surgical edits.
- Do not redesign the whole page when only content changes are requested.
- Do not add new frameworks/build steps unless explicitly requested.
- Keep performance-friendly static site approach.
