                <p class="lead">The clinometer app is the (hopefully most accurate) slope finder tool for any mobile device.</p>

                <p>It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. It is designed to be as accurate as possible (normally in the range of ±0.1 degrees, although this might depend on the device).</p>

                <p>With this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device in every direction. When the device is put flat on the table a bubble view will fade in.</p>

                <h3>User Manual</h3>
                
                <p>We'll highlight some features, others should be self explanatory. First about the calibration: You can calibrate the device in five directions independently. This is because the accelerometers give different deviations for each axis. However you can easily choose to calibrate the directions on demand.</p>

                <h4>Simple calibration</h4>
                <p>Switch off the fullscreen mode (tap on the center on the screen) in case you don't see the buttons on screen. Put the device flat on a table or hold the device in one of the four directions perpendicular to the surface (bottom side down, bottom side up, left side up or left side down). While holding the device, press the button that automatically gets enabled if you are holding the device correctly. Then just click finish and the calibration should be accurate as long as the surface was properly leveled.</p>

                <h4>Two-way calibration</h4>
                <p>If you are not sure if the surface you are using is levelled, you can choose to do a two-way calibration. First, start with the bubble calibration. Put the device flat on a table. Press the Bubble Up button. Then rotate the device by 180°.</p>

                <p>When the indicated level has stabilized, press the Turn and recalibrate Button. Now even if the surface was not levelled you will have a correct calibration.</p>

                <p>Now proceed with the other sides, where the clinometer will be shown. Hold the device with the left side up. While holding the device press the button that automatically gets enabled if you hold the device correctly. Then rotate the device so that the left side is facing upwards.</p>

                <p>Press the Turn and recalibrate button. Repeat the same procedure for the right side up. You may choose a level surface on the upper side to use as a reference because otherwise the volume buttons will be located between the surface and the device which will prevent an accurate calibration.</p>

                <p>Finally repeat the steps again with the bottom down and bottom up sides.</p>

                <h4>Motion sensitive lock</h4>
                <p>When you press the lock button you will notice a red flashing indicator. It tells you to set the device in a stable position. When the device is motionless for some time it will lock and you can pick up the device again to get a reading. The sensitivity of this locking can be adjusted in the settings.</p>

                <h4>Speech synthesis *</h4>
                <p>You can enable the speech synthesis in the settings. It will speak the current reading whenever it changes.</p>

                <h3>Further information and contact</h3>
                <p>According to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator.</p>

                <p><strong>For recreational use only.</strong> After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers.</p>
