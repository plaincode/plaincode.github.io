                <p class="lead">Visualize the hidden world of magnetic flux. It can be nicely used to visualize the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you.</p>

                <p>With limitations (see below) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in the wall (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS – just by measuring the local earth magnetic inclination (in contrast to GPS in general it works while flying a long trip in a plane to check how the inclination changes).</p>

                <h3>User Manual</h3>

                <p>The red buttons switches between the four main modes (Magnetometer, Magnetometer-Relative, Acceleration and Acceleration-Relative). The yellow button function depends on the main mode (3 sub-modes for Magnetometer and 4 sub-modes for Acceleration and Reset in Relative Mode). The yellow dot displays the sensor location of the combined accelerometer & magnetometer on screen.</p>

                <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> After start, first calibrate the magnetic field sensor. Usually, the best way to calibrate the magnetometer is by rotating the phone around its 3 axis. The application starts with in Magnetometer Absolute Mode. If your device has not magnetometer sensor, it will skip this mode and directly turns into the Acceleration Absolute Mode.</p>

                <h4>Magnetometer Main Mode</h4>
                <p>In this main mode the yellow button switches between the following sub-modes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absolute Mode (Initial):</strong> Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer. Don't be confused if it points downward (northern hemisphere) or upward (southern hemisphere), this visualizes the three dimensional magnetic field, unlike a compass which is limited to the horizontal contribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>North Mode:</strong> A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclination Mode:</strong> Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the inclination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Magnetometer Relative Main Mode</h4>
                <p>In this mode the yellow button resets the compensation vector. This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. When the device is rotated in any direction the compensation vector has to be reset by pressing the yellow button when holding steady.</p>

                <h4>Acceleration Main Mode</h4>
                <p>In this main mode the yellow button switches between the following sub-modes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Absolute Mode:</strong> Displays the reverse acceleration of the device (1g up when hold steady)</li>
                    <li><strong>Z-Rotation, Y-Rotation, X-Rotation:</strong> Display rotation around respective axes with angle indicators</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Final Notes</h3>
                <p>To use as a metal detector the objects need to be actively magnetic since physically no strong enough oscillation is actively produced on a typical mobile device (not specifically built for this application). This is fundamental.</p>

                <p><strong>For recreational use only.</strong> However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis.</p>
