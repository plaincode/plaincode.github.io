                <p class="lead">A professional geometry triangle for technical drawings, items alignment, model making and much more you can think of.</p>

                <h3>Basic angle measurement</h3>
                <p>The application can be used when the device is flat on the table. To take a measurement, first bring the device to the start position. Press the center of the screen. The indicator will reset the angle to zero. Now bring the device to the target position, ideally in a steady continuous movement to improve accuracy. Read the value as indicated. You can also measure angles that are perpendicular to the table, or arbitrary, just keep in mind to rotate the device around its z-axis (the axis perpendicular to the device screen) to get accurate results.</p>

                <h3>Measuring angles using motion lock</h3>
                <p>When you have activated the motion lock (this is the default setting) you can perform a measurement without having to look at the display in the target position. This is especially useful when this app is used as a goniometer in a more difficult terrain. The motion lock feature is by default activated. It can be activated or deactivated in the application settings. You can adjust the sensitivity of the motion lock there too.</p>

                <h3>Calibration</h3>
                <p>The in-built gyroscope accuracy varies from device to device. You can find out how your device differs from the default by taking a 180° measurement multiple times (as described in the "Basic angle measurement" paragraph) along a fixed object on your table.</p>

                <p>Your device might indicate slightly above or below the expected 180° value. If you device shows e.g. values of 177.4, 177.8 and 177.3 then take the median value of 177.5. Now enter this value ('177.5′) into the Settings → Calibration → "180°-Turn indicates" field.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you want to recalibrate, reset the calibration in the settings.</p>

                <h3>Further Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rotation Mode:</strong> This controls wether the foreground triangle or the background is rotated. Set it according to your visual preference. In one case the angle digital indicator rotates with the angle, in the other mode it keeps fixed to the device. Can be switched in the toolbar or in the Settings via "Rotate Set Square" → on/off</li>
                    <li><strong>Set Square Unit Mode:</strong> Select the angle unit mode according to your preference. It can be switched via a button in the toolbar or in the settings menu "Unit Mode" that belongs to the "Set Square" group</li>
                    <li><strong>Ruler Unit Mode:</strong> You can choose inch or cm for the ruler. The ruler unit mode can be selected in the settings: "Ruler" group → "Unit Mode"</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevent Auto-Lock:</strong> If you prevent auto lock the device won't go into power-save mode when running this application. Handle with care. By default it is switched off. Can be controlled in the Settings via "Prevent Auto-Lock"</li>
                    <li><strong>Full screen Mode:</strong> You can toggle between the full screen mode and normal screen mode via the arrow button in the toolbar.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Known Issues</h3>
                <p>The gyroscope may still drift even after a reset to zero. The drift will improve if you leave the device steady for a while.</p>

                <h3>Final Notes</h3>
                <p><strong>For recreational use only.</strong> However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the in-built gyroscope to its limits. If calibrated well the gyroscope typically is as good as 0.1° per 90° rotation.</p>
