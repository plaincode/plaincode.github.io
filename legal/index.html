                <h3>plaincode Legal Notice</h3>
                <p><em>Note: Under German law (§5 DDG - Digital Services Act), websites operated from Germany must provide legal disclosure (<a href="/legal/de.html">Impressum</a>) in German. This English version is provided for your convenience. The German version is the legally binding document and can be found <a href="/legal/de.html">here</a>.</em></p>

                <h3>1. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>The contents of this website are created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content provided. Use of the website's content is at the user's own risk. Posts identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always that of the provider. By merely using the provider's website, no contractual relationship is established between the user and the provider.</p>

                <h3>2. External Links</h3>
                <p>This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are the responsibility of their respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the third-party content for any legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link. Constant monitoring of external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, upon becoming aware of legal violations, such external links will be deleted immediately.</p>

                <h3>3. Copyright and Related Rights</h3>
                <p>The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and related rights law. Any use not permitted under German copyright and related rights law requires the prior written consent of the provider or the respective rights holder. This applies in particular to reproduction, editing, translation, storage, processing, or reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Third-party content and rights are identified as such. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of individual content or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable. Only the creation of copies and downloads for personal, private, and non-commercial use is permitted. The display of this website in third-party frames is only permitted with written permission.</p>
