                    <h3>The One That Got Away: 3DTouch Scale</h3>
                    <p class="post-meta">January 1, 2026</p>
                    <p>Happy New Year! For our first post of 2026, we're sharing a fun piece of plaincode history. Back in the iPhone 6s era, we developed an innovative app called <a href="/products/scale/">3DTouch Scale</a> that turned your iPhone into a digital weight scale using the pressure-sensitive 3D Touch sensors.</p>
                    <p>The concept was brilliant (if we say so ourselves): measure fruits directly on the screen, or use a clever finger-balancing technique for non-capacitive objects. We even made a demo video! But alas, Apple had concerns about potential hardware damage from users placing heavy objects on their screens. The app never made it past review. 📱⚖️ 🚫</p>
                    <p>You can still <a href="/products/scale/">check out what could have been</a>—it's preserved here as a testament to creative (if slightly risky) hardware experimentation. Sometimes the best ideas are the ones that make reviewers nervous! 😄</p>

                    <p>A required update of the iContacts+ is now rolled out as version 2.8. In iOS14 the old API was not supported anymore and the updated app uses the modern Contact framework.
