                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p><em>Note: This English version is provided for your convenience. The German version is the legally binding document and can be found <a href="/privacy/de.html">here</a>.</em></p>

                <p>We value your privacy. This privacy policy applies to both our website and all of our published mobile apps (iOS and Android).</p>

                <h3 id="website">1. This Website</h3>

                <h4>What data is collected?</h4>
                <p>This website is a static website hosted via GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect basic server log data (IP addresses, browser type, access times) for technical purposes. This data is processed exclusively by GitHub and is not shared with us. For more information, please see the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

                <p>We do not use tracking or analytics tools. We do not use cookies for marketing or analytics purposes.</p>

                <h3 id="mobile-apps">2. Mobile Apps</h3>

                <p>This privacy policy governs your use of our mobile applications (including Clinometer, Magnetometer, AccelMeter, iSetSquare, Contacts by Number, MagicHue, and similar apps) created by plaincode (Peter Breitling).</p>

                <h4>What Information Do the Applications Obtain?</h4>

                <p><strong>User Provided Information:</strong> Our applications do not ask for user provided information.</p>

                <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> The applications collect and transmit certain information automatically to our servers (plaincode.com) in an anonymized way, including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type of mobile device you use (device model, manufacturer)</li>
                    <li>Mobile device's unique vendor identifier (iOS: identifierForVendor; Android: device-specific ID)</li>
                    <li>IP address of your mobile device (anonymized during server-side processing)</li>
                    <li>Mobile operating system and version</li>
                    <li>CPU architecture</li>
                    <li>App build version</li>
                    <li>Device language preference</li>
                    <li>App store from which the app was downloaded</li>
                    <li>Information about the way the application is used (e.g., number of app starts)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How data is transmitted:</strong> This data is transmitted when you access the in-app help/documentation features, which load content from plaincode.com servers with the above information included as URL parameters. The vendor identifier is app-vendor-specific (it's different for each app vendor on your device and cannot be used to track you across different companies' apps). No personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or phone number is collected.</p>

                <h4>Why Do We Collect Data?</h4>
                <p>We obtain data to provide the intended application functionality, to find bugs, and to improve and prioritize application features. We try to keep the data we collect as minimal as possible.</p>

                <h4>Do We Sell Your Data?</h4>
                <p>No. We do not sell data. This is not and will not be our business model.</p>

                <h4>Third-Party Access</h4>
                <p>Only the services used to automatically collect data have access. They are configured to only collect the data in an anonymized way.</p>

                <h4>Sensor Data</h4>
                <p>All sensor data used by our apps (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, camera, etc.) is processed exclusively locally on your device and is not transmitted.</p>

                <h4>Device Access</h4>
                <p>Our apps require access to certain device features (e.g., camera, sensors, contacts) to provide their functionality. These accesses are used only locally.</p>

                <h4>In-App Purchases</h4>
                <p>Purchase transactions are processed through the respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). We do not receive payment information. Please refer to the privacy policies of <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>.</p>

                <h4>Opt-Out Rights</h4>
                <p>You can stop all collection of information by the application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

                <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We will retain automatically collected information for up to 24 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate.</p>

                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our applications. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

                <h3>3. General Provisions</h3>

                <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>

                <h4>Third Party Links</h4>
                <p>This website may contain links to external websites (e.g., App Store, Google Play). These websites have their own privacy policies. We have no responsibility for the content and privacy practices of these linked sites.</p>

                <h4>Your Rights</h4>
                <p>Under GDPR, you have the right to access, rectification, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, and objection regarding the anonymized analytics data collected by our mobile applications.</p>

                <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>We reserve the right to update this privacy policy to reflect changes in legal requirements or our services. If we add a feature that would need to obtain user-provided data, this privacy statement will be updated. Any change will be visible to the user before the data is obtained (e.g., as a click agreement as part of a registration process). The current version is always available on this page.</p>
                <p>This policy was last updated on February 19, 2026</p>
